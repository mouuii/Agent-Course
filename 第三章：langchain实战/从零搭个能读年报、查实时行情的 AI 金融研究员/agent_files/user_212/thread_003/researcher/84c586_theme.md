Amazon’s strategy for 2025 focuses on massive infrastructure investment and segment-specific optimizations.
- **Infrastructure & AWS:** Amazon has signaled a "meaningful increase" in capital expenditures, primarily to support technology infrastructure for AWS. This is driven by the rising demand for cloud services and generative AI capabilities.
- **Logistics & Fulfillment:** Continued investments in the fulfillment network and delivery speed are expected to remain a core pillar of the North American and International retail segments.
- **Revenue Mix:** Growth is anticipated across the "flywheel"—advertising revenue, Prime memberships, and third-party seller services—which typically carry higher margins than first-party retail.

### Summary
Amazon enters 2025 with strong momentum, characterized by double-digit revenue growth and robust operating income guidance. Analysts are almost universally bullish, citing a target price near $300 and a projected EPS of $7.85. The company's strategic focus remains centered on expanding its AI and cloud capabilities through AWS, while leveraging accounting efficiencies and fulfillment optimizations to bolster net income.
