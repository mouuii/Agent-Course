## Profitability, Operating Margins, and Net Income Trends for Amazon in 2023 and 2024

### Focused Query 1: Amazon consolidated operating margin 2023-2024
**Key Findings:**
*   **Operating Margin Expansion:** Amazon's consolidated operating margin expanded significantly from 2.4% in 2022 to 6.4% in 2023, and reached approximately 10.8% in 2024.
*   **Segment Contribution:** The margin expansion was driven by all three segments. AWS margins reached 37% in 2024, while North America and International segments moved from losses in 2022 to strong profitability by 2024.
*   **Depreciation Benefit:** Profitability was boosted by a change in the estimated useful life of servers and networking equipment, which reduced depreciation expense by $3.2 billion in 2024.

### Focused Query 2: Amazon net income growth 2022 vs 2023 vs 2024
**Key Findings:**
*   **Net Income Rebound:** Net income recovered from a loss of $2.7 billion in 2022 to a profit of $30.4 billion in 2023. In 2024, net income nearly doubled again to $59.2 billion.
*   **Earnings Per Share (EPS):** Diluted EPS rose from ($0.27) in 2022 to $2.90 in 2023 and jumped to $5.53 in 2024.
*   **Non-Operating Volatility:** Net income continues to be impacted by fluctuations in the valuation of Amazon's equity investment in Rivian Automotive, which resulted in a $1.6 billion non-operating loss in 2024 compared to an $800 million gain in 2023.

### Focused Query 3: Amazon free cash flow 2023-2024
**Key Findings:**
*   **Free Cash Flow (FCF) Turnaround:** FCF improved from a $3.3 billion outflow for the TTM ended March 31, 2023, to a $50.1 billion inflow for the TTM ended March 31, 2024.
*   **Operating Cash Flow:** Net cash provided by operating activities reached $115.9 billion in 2024, up from $84.9 billion in 2023.
*   **Capital Expenditures:** Amazon significantly ramped up capital expenditures in 2024 to $77.7 billion (up from $48.1 billion in 2023), primarily to support AWS infrastructure and generative AI initiatives. Despite this massive investment, the company maintained a positive FCF of $38.2 billion for the full year 2024.

### Summary
Amazon's profitability trajectory in 2023 and 2024 marks one of the most significant turnarounds in its history. By focusing on cost efficiencies in its retail business and benefiting from the high-margin growth of AWS and Advertising, the company more than quadrupled its operating income in two years. A key highlight is the company's ability to generate record-level operating cash flows, which allowed it to self-fund a massive $77 billion capital investment cycle in 2024 focused on AI and cloud infrastructure while still delivering substantial free cash flow to the bottom line.
