Revenue growth was steady at 12% in 2023 and 11% in 2024, driven primarily by the acceleration of AWS (which grew 19% in 2024) and the continued expansion of high-margin services like Advertising and Third-party Seller Services. The company successfully optimized its fulfillment network and shifted toward more profitable service-based revenue streams, leading to a substantial expansion in operating margins.
