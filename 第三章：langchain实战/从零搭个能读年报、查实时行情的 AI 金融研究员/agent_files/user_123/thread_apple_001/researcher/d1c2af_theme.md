## Apple's Key Revenue and Net Income Trends (Fiscal Years 2023-2024)

### Focused Query 1: Apple annual revenue and net income fiscal year 2023
Fiscal Year 2023 (ended September 30, 2023) saw Apple's total net sales decrease by 3% compared to the previous year, totaling $383.3 billion. Net income for the year was $97.0 billion, a slight decrease from the $99.8 billion reported in 2022. The decline in revenue was primarily driven by lower sales of Mac and iPhone and the impact of foreign currency fluctuations (the strength of the U.S. dollar), which was partially offset by record-high net sales in the Services segment.

**Key Financials for FY 2023:**
- **Total Net Sales:** $383,285 million (-3% YoY)
- **Net Income:** $96,995 million (-2.8% YoY)
- **Diluted EPS:** $6.13 (a slight increase from $6.11 in 2022 due to share repurchases)
- **Gross Margin:** $169,148 million (44.1% margin)

### Focused Query 2: Apple revenue and net income fiscal year 2024
Fiscal Year 2024 (ended September 28, 2024) marked a return to revenue growth for Apple, with total net sales rising 2% to $391.0 billion. However, net income decreased to $93.7 billion. This decrease in net income was specifically due to a one-time income tax charge of $10.2 billion related to the European Court of Justice's (ECJ) decision on state aid in Ireland. Excluding this charge, Apple's underlying profitability showed significant strength, with operating income increasing by 7.8% year-over-year.

### Summary
Apple's financial performance in 2023 and 2024 reflects a period of stabilization and transition. After a slight revenue contraction in 2023 due to macroeconomic headwinds and currency effects, Apple returned to growth in 2024. While 2024's reported net income was dragged down by a multi-billion dollar one-time tax ruling in Europe, the company's operating income and gross margins reached new heights, demonstrating strong pricing power and the continued growth of high-margin services. The gross margin percentage improved significantly from 44.1% in 2023 to 46.2% in 2024, highlighting operational efficiency and a favorable shift in product mix.
