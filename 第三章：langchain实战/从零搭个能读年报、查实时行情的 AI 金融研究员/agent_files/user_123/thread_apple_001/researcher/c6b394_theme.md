### Focused Query 2: Segment performance analysis 2023 2024 trends and drivers
*   **iPhone:** Remained Apple's largest segment, contributing over 50% of total revenue. In 2023, sales fell 2% due to lower demand for non-Pro models. In 2024, revenue stabilized (flat YoY) as higher net sales of Pro models offset declines in standard models.
*   **Services:** This segment was the standout performer, growing 9% in 2023 and accelerating to 13% in 2024. Growth was primarily driven by higher revenue from advertising, the App Store, cloud services, and video.
*   **Mac:** Experienced a massive 27% decline in 2023 due to challenging comparisons and lower laptop sales. It saw a modest 2% recovery in 2024, attributed to higher net sales of new laptop models.
*   **iPad:** Declined in both years. The 6% decline in 2024 was driven by lower sales of the iPad Pro and entry-level models, though the third quarter of 2024 saw a 24% surge following the launch of new iPad Pro and iPad Air models.
*   **Wearables, Home and Accessories:** This segment declined 3% in 2023 and 7% in 2024. The 2024 decline occurred despite the launch of Apple Vision Pro in February 2024, indicating that lower sales of Apple Watch and AirPods outweighed the contribution from the new spatial computer.

### Summary
Apple's financial performance by segment in 2023 and 2024 highlights a "Services-first" growth story. While the iPhone remains the bedrock of the company's revenue, its growth has matured into a stable, high-value (Pro-focused) replacement cycle. The Services segment has successfully picked up the slack, showing accelerating double-digit growth. Hardware segments like Mac and iPad faced significant post-pandemic headwinds in 2023 but showed signs of stabilization or tactical recovery (e.g., iPad in Q3 2024) through product refreshes. The Wearables segment remains under pressure as legacy product categories face saturation, even with the introduction of new categories like Vision Pro.
